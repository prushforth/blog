# &lt;web-map&gt; Custom Element

The &lt;web-map&gt; Custom Element is a [prototype implementation](http://maps4html.github.io/Web-Map-Custom-Element/) of the [HTML-Map-Element specification](http://maps4html.github.io/HTML-Map-Element/spec/).

## Objective

The objective of this web component is to demonstrate the feasibility of modifying / upgrading / augmenting the &lt;map&gt; HTML element to support modern Web mapping requirements.  As such, it relies on [Map Markup Language](http://maps4html.github.io/mapml/spec/) which delivers map information as hypertext.
This element depends on the [MapML Leaflet Client javascript library](https://github.com/Maps4HTML/MapML-Leaflet-Client).
